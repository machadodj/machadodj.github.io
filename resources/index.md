Below, you will find a list of selected applications and databases produced by the Phyloinformatics Lab. Our lab is interested in tools that facilitate comparative genomics and bioinformatics of non-model organisms, focusing on host-pathogen or host-parasite systems. We are also interested in developing dedicated gene prediction and annotation tools for a range of models, from flatworms to viruses. Finally, we produce software that aids in phylogenetic analyses.
