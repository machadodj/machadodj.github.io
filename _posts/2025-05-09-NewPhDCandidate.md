We are thrilled to share that Giovanna Yumi Scorsim Omura has successfully passed her dissertation proposal defense and is now officially a Ph.D. candidate in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at UNC Charlotte!

Giovanna’s work explores museum genomics of _Triodopsis_ Rafinesque, 1819 (Stylommatophora: Polygyridae) land snails and aims to close the distance between bioinformatics and natural history collections.

We’re proud of Giovanna’s achievements and can’t wait to see where her research takes her next. Congratulations, Candidate Yumi Scorsim Omura—you’ve earned this milestone!
