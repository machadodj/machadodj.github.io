# Workflow automation

Do you have unwieldy computational projects that are hard to keep track of? Is it easy to forget which steps of your pipeline need to be rerun when something changes? Are you trying to make your work reproducible?
 
If so, the next HPC Group workshop is for you! On Tuesday, April 23rd, from 1-2 PM, we will discuss workflow automation. We will teach you what it is, when to use it, and how to use it with two popular tools: Snakemake and Nextflow. The event will be held in UNC Charlotteâ€™s CIPHER center, room BINF 408.
