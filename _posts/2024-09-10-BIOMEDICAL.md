# Phyloinformatics Lab at the 2024 Biomedical Sciences Symposium

On September 9th, the 2024 Biomedical Sciences Symposium took place at the UNC Charlotte Dubois Center, bringing together leading minds in science, engineering, and computing. This prestigious event, powered by the UNC Charlotte Division of Research and hosted by the College of Science, College of Engineering, and College of Computing and Informatics in collaboration with NCBiotech, highlighted cutting-edge research and innovative solutions in biomedical sciences.

Ms. Reyhaneh Nouri presented her research, "Unveiling the Modulators of Mutable Collagenous Tissue in the Brittle Star _Ophiomastix wendtii_: An RNA-Seq Analysis." This work, a collaboration with Drs. Vladimir Mashanov (Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine - WFIRM) and Denis Jacob Machado (UNC Charlotte), explores the regulation of mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) in brittle stars, with potential implications for developing smart and dynamic biomaterials. Her presentation was well-received and underscored the innovative research in the Phyloinformatics Lab at UNC Charlotte.
