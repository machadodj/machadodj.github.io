# Bridging Disciplines: Phyloinformatics Lab Supports Study on Inclusive Education

We’re happy to share that our lab recently had the chance to support a fascinating interdisciplinary project led by [Dr. Xiaoxia Newton](https://edld.charlotte.edu/directory/xiaoxia-newton-0/) from the CATO College of Education here at UNC Charlotte. The study, published in Assessment for Effective Intervention, focused on improving inclusive instruction for students receiving special education services for emotional disturbance (ED).

Dr. Denis Jacob Machado, our lab director, contributed to this important work by assisting with R-based statistical modeling—specifically, hierarchical omega analyses used to validate a survey tool examining three key inclusive practices: Behavior Support, Differentiation, and Classroom Management.

This collaboration is a wonderful example of how bioinformatics tools and skills can extend beyond biology to support research in education and the social sciences. We were honored to contribute to a project that promotes evidence-based practices for some of the most vulnerable students in our school systems.
