Friends, we did it! The Philoinformatics Lab, part of the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics at UNC Charlotte, and our beloved CIPHER Center, just turned three years old! Can you believe it? Time flies when you’re doing science, laughing, and grilling vegan patties.

We celebrated the way Brazilians know best: with food, fun, and a lot of coração. The grill was busy with vegan hot dogs and patties, the dessert table was covered with cake and joy, and of course, we had sodas and refreshments to keep the conversations flowing. Our PhD students brought a big shiny three-year balloon (lindo demais!) and even gifted the PI (that's me!) a t-shirt that says “Legend Since August 2022.” What can I say? These students know how to make their PI blush.

This little party was more than snacks and balloons—it was a reminder of how much we’ve grown together. In just three years, the lab has become a true community. We’re thriving, collaborating, and building something that feels bigger than ourselves. And honestly, we couldn’t have done it without our students, collaborators, and friends. Vocês são incríveis.

So here’s to the past three years, to all the memories we’ve already made, and to the many more we will celebrate. We’re just getting started — and the best is yet to come.
