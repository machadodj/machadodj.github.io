A new article entitled "Diversity and phylogenetic position of the amphi-American lineages of the tapeworms of the genus _Anthocephalum_ Linton, 1890 (Rhinebothriidea: Anthocephaliidae)" was published on the journal Zootaxa (DOI: [10.11646/zootaxa.5584.2.1](https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.5584.2.1)). The article was authored by Lilian F. Sakai, Fernando Portella de Luna Marques, and Bruna Trevisan, from the University of São Paulo (Brazil).

This paper explores the diversity, evolutionary history, and classification of a group of tapeworms belonging to the family Anthocephaliidae, with a focus on the genus _Anthocephalum_. Tapeworms are parasitic flatworms that live inside the intestines of fish and other animals. Despite recent research, many details about their classification and evolution remain unclear.

To better understand these tapeworms, the researchers analyzed DNA from 15 specimens collected from different locations, including Brazil, Panama, and Senegal. Using genetic sequencing and advanced computational techniques, they reconstructed the evolutionary relationships between different species. Their findings confirmed that Anthocephaliidae is a valid group, but they also revealed inconsistencies within its classification. Specifically, they discovered that the genus _Alveobothrium_, previously considered separate, should actually be merged into _Anthocephalum_. This revision increases the number of recognized _Anthocephalum_ species to 30.

Additionally, the researchers found four new lineages of _Anthocephalum_, indicating that many more species might exist in unexplored regions or hosts. Their biogeographical analysis suggests that these tapeworms likely originated in the Central Indo-Pacific region and then spread to different areas over time.

## Why is this important?

- Refines the classification of tapeworms, ensuring species are properly named and grouped.
- Expands knowledge of tapeworm diversity, highlighting undiscovered species.
- Provides insights into their evolutionary history, showing how they spread across different regions.
- Aids in future studies by suggesting better methods for analyzing tapeworm evolution.

## What species was named after Denis?

_Anthocephalum machadoi_ is a newly described species of tapeworm belonging to the family Anthocephaliidae within the order Rhinebothriidea. It was discovered in the spiral intestine of the longnose stingray (_Hypanus guttatus_), which serves as its type host. The species was primarily identified along the coast of Maceió, Alagoas, Brazil, with additional specimens found in Colares, Pará, Brazil.

Compared to other species in _Anthocephalum_, _A. machadoi_ is unique in its combination of size, loculi count, and reproductive organ arrangement:

- It has more marginal loculi than _A. blairi_, _A. gravisi_, _A. haroldsoni_, and _A. papefayei_, but fewer than _A. gracile_, _A. healyae_, _A. lukei_, _A. meadowsi_, and others.
- The number of testes (35–46) is distinct from related species such as _A. decrisantisorum_, _A. jensenae_, and _A. ruhnkei_, which have significantly fewer or more testes​

The etymology of _A. machadoi_ reads: "This species honors Dr. Denis Jacob Machado for his contribution to the systematics of cestodes through his expertise in bioinformatics."

The identification of _A. machadoi_ highlights the underexplored diversity of parasitic tapeworms in stingrays, emphasizing the need for further taxonomic and biogeographical studies. This discovery also contributes to the ongoing revision of _Anthocephalum_ taxonomy and its evolutionary relationships.
