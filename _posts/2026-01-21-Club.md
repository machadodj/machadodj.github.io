#  Phyloinformatics Club: Spring 2026

## Spring 2026 Schedule

This semester, the Phyloinformatics Club will meet *every other week*, starting on Jan. 21, 2026. Meetings will be on *Wednesdays*, from *4:15 PM to 5:45 PM*, via *Google Meet*. Participants will receive invites with Google Meet links via *Google Calendar.*

Please email our Ph.D. student, Giovanna Yumi Scorsim Omura, if you want to join the Phyloinformatics Club.

**Anyone, at any level in phylogenetics, is welcome to join if they complete the assigned reading and homework.**

## Recommended Materials

We are back after having finished an introduction to Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood in 2025. We are now diving into Bayesian Inference.

To review the basics of homology, synapomorphy, and homoplasy in cladistics, I recommend reading Nixon & Carpenter's (2011) paper, “On Homology,” available at [DOI 10.1111/j.1096-0031.2011.00371.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2011.00371.x).

To review the basics of posterior probabilities in phylogenetics, I recommend watching a video, “Phylodynamics 101: Bayesian Analysis Molecular Sequences,” by the Fogarty International Center at NIH.[Click here to watch the video](https://youtu.be/Sjos_CeeCcU?si=VmMveVK73on9t_pg).

Finally, don’t forget to complete the homework below.

## Homework

For the next meeting, students should read *Chapter 12* of Wheeler's book, “*Systematics: A Course of Lectures**,” and answer the *first two questions* at the end of that chapter.
