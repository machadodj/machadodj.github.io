#  New Student Support Resources from CAPS: Snacks, Workshops & Pláticas

Colleagues, as we navigate the start of the Spring 2026 semester, we wanted to highlight some excellent resources from the Center for [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://caps.charlotte.edu/) to share with your students.

## CAPS Meet & Greet

- *When:* Jan. 22, 2026 (Thursday), from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
- *Where:* SoVi (South Village Dining)
- *What:* Students can grab a snack, learn about upcoming workshops, and meet clinicians in a casual, low-pressure environment.

## "Pláticas" Support Space

We specifically want to highlight *Pláticas*, a dedicated support space where students can discuss common stressors within the Latinx community. This is a vital resource for our students seeking culturally aware support. [Click here to see Pláticas list of groups](https://caps.charlotte.edu/services/group-counseling).
