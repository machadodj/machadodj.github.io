# Fall 2024 Bioinformatics Poster Showcase

The Bioinformatics Graduate Student Poster Presentation happened Friday, November 22nd at 3:30pm (immediately following our Bioinformatics Seminar series) on the 2nd floor of the bioinformatics building (9331 Robert D. Snyder Rd, Charlotte, NC 28262, USA). Below, we list each of our students, their poster titles, and the link for the poster and digital materials:
