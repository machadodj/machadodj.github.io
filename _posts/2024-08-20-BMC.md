## Exciting News: Denis Was Appointed as Editorial Board Member of BMC Genomic Data

I am thrilled to announce that I have been appointed as an Editorial Board Member of **BMC Genomic Data**, a prestigious open-access journal under **Springer Nature**. This appointment, confirmed on August 20, 2024, represents a significant milestone in my academic journey.

**Springer Nature** is dedicated to advancing discovery by publishing trusted research, supporting the development of new ideas, and championing open science. As part of this mission, **BMC Genomic Data**—formerly known as BMC Genetics—plays a crucial role in the scientific community. The journal welcomes submissions that describe genomic and genetic research data, report new analyses of genomic data, and introduce community databases, all while promoting the sharing of data to further open science.

I am honored to join the Editorial Board and contribute to the journal's efforts in advancing the field of genomics. I look forward to collaborating with fellow board members and researchers to support the publication of high-quality research that addresses the world’s urgent challenges.

Thank you for your continued support and encouragement as I embark on this exciting new role.
