# Phylogenetics in the one health context

Our new reserach topic is out on Frontiers in Mycrobiology, and it is all about phylogenetics and its different applications in One Health.

"Omics” technologies (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) have revolutionized human health. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, genomic epidemiology consolidated as an essential tool to study emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans. However, we can maximize the effectiveness of genomics epidemiology in humans by accounting for diseases' animal and environmental components. The unifying approach to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals, and ecosystems is called “One Health.” Unfortunately, no single “omics” technology is sufficient to understand complex host-pathogen systems in the One Health context. Therefore, this Frontier's Research Topic explores the role of phylogenetics in providing an evolutionary context to integrate “omics” technologies to understand complex biological systems and provide a timely literature foundation for future efforts to bridge the gap between basic research in biodiversity and applied biomedical research on EIDs.
