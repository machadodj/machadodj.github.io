On March 27, 2025, Dr. Denis Jacob Machado, Assistant Professor and Director of the Phyloinformatics Lab, served as a panelist for The PREPP (Postdoctoral Readiness to Enter the Professorship Program), a collaborative professional development initiative across the UNC system. Hosted via Zoom and attended by 45 postdoctoral researchers from institutions including NC State University, UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Charlotte, NC A&T, NC Central, ECU, and UNC-Wilmington, the session focused on “Preparing for the Faculty Interview.”

Dr. Machado joined fellow panelists Dr. Skylar Hopkins, Dr. Ebony Jones, and Dr. Maria Rodgers to share personal experiences, best practices, and lessons learned from their own faculty interview journeys. The conversation addressed common postdoc concerns such as navigating presentation expectations, preparing for difficult questions, negotiating offers, and projecting leadership potential as early-career scientists.

The PREPP series is designed to demystify the academic job market and support postdocs in transitioning successfully into faculty careers. The Phyloinformatics Lab is proud to contribute to initiatives that empower the next generation of academic researchers.
