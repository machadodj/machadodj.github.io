## About the conference

At the [Mutations in Space and Time](https://www.mutationmeeting.com/) meeting, [Anastasiia Duchenko](https://phyloinformatics.com/members/Anastasiia_Duchenko.html) joined leading researchers exploring the origins, patterns, and impacts of mutations across biological systems—spanning cells, tissues, individuals, populations, and species, in contexts of health, aging, and disease. This in-person event featured cutting-edge science, engaging discussions, and valuable networking opportunities.

## About our work

[Anastasiia Duchenko](https://phyloinformatics.com/members/Anastasiia_Duchenko.html) presented her poster on April 23, 2025. The title of her poster was “Automated Protocol for Testing Crucial Mutations in Coronaviruses Using AI: Insights into Immune Escape and Resistance.” The work was also authored byDrs. Daniel Janies and Denis Jacob Machado. [Click here to go to the GitLab project for the poster](https://gitlab.com/staisyelash/2025_mutationsintimeandspace_duchenko).
