On September 27, 2022, the cover of Volume 37, Issue 5 of Cladistics was designed by Dr. Denis Jacob Machado and inspired on a paper publised in that same issue. The paper entitled "Fundamental evolution of all Orthocoronavirinae including three deadly lineages descendent from Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2" was co-authored by Rachel Scott, Sayal Guirales, and Daniel A. Janies.
