# We’re Building STEAM In Kannapolis

Join us for a variety of fun family events on **October 7**, as we celebrate (STEAM) - Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math.

The Building STEAM Festival will be held from **10 a.m. to 2 p.m.** at the North Carolina Research Campus Horseshoe (**401 Laureate Way, Kannapolis**). The event is **free** and will include activities for children, teenagers, and parents – both indoors and outdoors on the campus.

Bring your lab coats and get your hands dirty with hands-on art and design, chemistry, life sciences, earth and space sciences and mathematics activities, experiments, and projects.

You will be able to join our partners:
