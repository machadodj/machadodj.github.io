# Exciting Research Internship Opportunity for Ph.D. Student Igor Salles de Oliveira at UNC Charlotte

We are thrilled to announce an exciting new opportunity for Igor Salles de Oliveira, a Ph.D. student at the University of São Paulo (USP), to embark on a transformative research internship at the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics (BiG) at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte), USA. This proposal has been submitted through the "Edital PRPG no. 11/2024 - Mobilidade Santander – Discentes" program, which supports international academic mobility.

## A World-Class Research Environment at UNC Charlotte

UNC Charlotte is recognized as a leading institution in bioinformatics and genomics research. Ranked among the top universities globally (601-800 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings), it offers a collaborative and multidisciplinary research environment that is essential for cutting-edge studies in genomics. During this internship, Igor will be working in the prestigious Phyloinformatics Lab, part of UNC Charlotte's Center for Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental Risks (CIPHER). This state-of-the-art facility is fully equipped with advanced molecular labs, high-performance computing clusters, and cutting-edge DNA sequencing technologies, including Illumina and PromethION Nanopore sequencers.

## Research Focus: Genomics of Endangered Insular Snakes

The focus of Igor's internship will be his doctoral research, which investigates the genomics of endangered insular snakes from the Bothrops jararaca group. This research is of great ecological importance, aiming to understand the genetic architecture and evolutionary history of these species, which are threatened by extinction along the Brazilian coast.

Through this internship, Igor will gain invaluable hands-on experience in high-throughput DNA sequencing, gene annotation, and genomic data analysis. The expertise and infrastructure at UNC Charlotte will allow him to advance his thesis, offering new insights into conservation strategies for these unique species. The research also opens doors to comparative studies that could deepen our understanding of the evolutionary adaptations of island-dwelling species.

## International Collaboration and Support

This internship is made possible through close collaboration between Igor’s Brazilian advisor, Dr. Maria José de Jesus Silva from USP, and Dr. Denis J. Machado at UNC Charlotte. Their partnership ensures that Igor will be able to maximize his research potential in a world-class lab. Notably, Dr. Machado has already secured $9,060.48 in funding to cover the reagents required for genomic sequencing, which will allow the research to move forward without additional financial burdens.

## What This Internship Means for the Future

Igor’s three-month internship, proposed to run from January 13th to April 12th, 2025, represents a crucial stage in his academic and professional development. By joining the research efforts at UNC Charlotte, Igor will be exposed to advanced scientific methodologies and the global research community. The knowledge and skills he will gain during this period will significantly contribute to both his thesis and his future career in the field of genomics and conservation biology.

Additionally, this opportunity highlights the strength of international academic partnerships and the importance of supporting student mobility for scientific advancement. The Santander mobility program plays a pivotal role in facilitating these types of exchanges, allowing students like Igor to access resources and expertise that are not readily available in their home institutions.

## Looking Ahead

We are confident that this internship will be a transformative experience for Igor and will significantly contribute to the progress of his research. As his journey unfolds, we look forward to sharing updates and insights from his time at UNC Charlotte. This opportunity is a testament to the value of collaboration, innovation, and academic excellence, and we wish Igor all the best as he embarks on this important chapter of his research.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting international research internship!

This is a major step in fostering international collaboration in science, and we hope it serves as inspiration for many more students to pursue similar opportunities.
