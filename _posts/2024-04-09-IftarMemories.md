# Photos from Yesterday's Ramadan Kareem: Iftar Party

We appreciate everyone that participated, including CCI's faculty and staff and student organizations. It was a truly beautiful, cultural event of sharing and support for the 2024 National Arab American Heritage Month. Here are some photos from the event.
