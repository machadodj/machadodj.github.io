# Denis is a Safety Champion Nominee

During the 2024 Safe and Sound week, the campus community was given the opportunity to nominate individuals from their department they felt displayed exceptional safety and health practices. I am please to say that I was selected! Congratulations on being a Safety Champion!

To celebrate this achievement, Derricka Clyburn, representing UNC Charlotte's Environmental Health & Safety (EHS), delivered me a special token honoring our lab.

## What is Environmental Health & Safety (EHS)

The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is an environmentally friendly, healthy, and safe place to work, teach and learn. Here you will find valuable information regarding regulatory compliance programs, EHS services, workplace hazard controls, training, injury prevention, and other helpful resources to support you in your role as a student, employee, or supervisor.
