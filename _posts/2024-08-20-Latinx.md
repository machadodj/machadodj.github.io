# Exciting News: Elected Communications Officer of the Latinx/Hispanic Staff/Faculty Caucus

The Latinx/Hispanic Faculty and Staff Caucus support community efforts that celebrate our diverse cultures at UNC Charlotte and in the region. The members of the Caucus work to enhance the community of Latino/Hispanic faculty, staff, and students on campus.

The Caucus was first formed in Fall 2012. We have meetings throughout the academic year and encourage any Latino/Hispanic Faculty or Staff, as well as anyone interested in Latino/Hispanic issues, to attend.

In August 2024, I (Denis) was honored to be elected as the new Communications Officer, succeeding the remarkable work of Paloma Fernández Sánchez. As I step into this role, I am committed to continuing Paloma's legacy of effectively communicating our mission and strengthening the bonds within our community. I look forward to collaborating with all of you to further our shared goals and celebrate the richness of our Latinx/Hispanic heritage.
