# New Fullbright Application

The Phyloinformatics lab has finalized and submitted a new grant proposal. This time, we worked with our collaborator in Pakistan, Dr. Muhammad Iqbal Qureshi, to submit a proposal for a Fullbright scholarship through the U.S. Educational Foundation in Pakistan (USEFP; process no. FS/2025/45360) that could allow him to visit UNC Charlotte for 12 months if approved.

Dr. Iqbal is based in the National Institute of Virology, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi-75270, Sindh.

His project is entitled "Machine Learning to Study Dengue Virus Recombination in Pakistan and Worldwide." The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop and validate new software capable of detecting viral recombination events on a pandemic scale, specifically using DENV genomic data. The proposed software shall overcome the limitations of current methods by efficiently processing large-scale viral genomic datasets, providing critical insights into the frequency, patterns, and impacts of recombination on viral evolution and public health.
