We just made a major breakthrough in understanding the evolution of proteocephalidean tapeworms, and it all comes down to something unexpected—machine learning!

Our latest study, now published in Cladistics (DOI: [10.1111/cla.12610](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cla.12610)), is the first to use machine learning to uncover deep evolutionary patterns in these fascinating parasites. Traditionally, tapeworm phylogenies have been difficult to reconcile with host species and biogeography. At first glance, the evolutionary tree seems to tell one story, while host and geographic data appear disconnected. But what if there were hidden relationships beneath the surface?

Using random forests, a type of machine learning model, we tested whether host and biogeographical data could accurately predict the evolutionary clades of these tapeworms. The results? A striking 88.85% accuracy in classifying species into clades. This means that, despite what traditional methods suggest, host and location actually do play a strong role in shaping the evolution of these parasites—just not in a way that conventional two-dimensional analyses could detect.

This study is a game-changer. It shows that the relationship between parasites, their hosts, and geography isn’t just a chaotic web—it follows hidden rules that only a multidimensional approach can reveal. We’re now opening up a whole new way of thinking about parasite evolution, one that integrates big data, computational intelligence, and deep biological insights.
