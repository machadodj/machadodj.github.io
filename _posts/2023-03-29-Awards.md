# Congratulations

Congratulations to [Reyhaneh Nouri](https://phyloinformatics.com/members/Reyhaneh_Nouri.html) and [Omkar Marne](https://phyloinformatics.com/members/Omkar_Marne.html). They both wrote summer research projects and will received a summer fellowship to support master’s or early-stage doctoral students’ research, paid in June, $5,000 USD per student.

Nouri will work on "identifying differentially expressed genes associated with mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) in the brittle star _Ophiomastix wendtii_." Marne will work on a "phylogenomics and machine learning framework for discriminating SARS-CoV-2 variants and predict their mutation rates." We will report their reserach findings and any products and publications in this website.
