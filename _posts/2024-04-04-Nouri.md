Reyhaneh Nouri was a guest speaker in UNC Charlotte's undergraduate class BIOL-3231L (Invertebrate Zoology) on April 4, 2024. She gave a talk on “How can we reversibly control collagen pliability? An investigation of mutable collagenous tissue in the brittle star _Ophiomastix wendtii_" (originally presented at the presented at UNC Charlotte’s 9th Annual Biological Sciences Research Symposium Program). We thank Dr. Aline Costa for the invitation. It was great to be in a lab and observe some real echinoderms with the students.
