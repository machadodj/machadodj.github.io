# Old but gold: the Willi Hennig Society Breaking Isolation lectures

[The Willi Hennig Society](https://cladistics.org/)'s Breaking Isolation project is a series of online lectures and conversations that created an open and diverse environment to share and discuss novel contributions as well as classic topics in systematics and biogeography. The goal of this series was to increase the visibility of the work of colleagues around the globe and to promote interaction and discussion among a broad community.

The Phyloinformatics Lab was honored to participate in this series on April 28, 2022 ([click here](https://youtu.be/G8bIzwrL4Fk?si=5Ffrc2KyS2hb55O2)).
