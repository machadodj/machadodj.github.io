## Twenty years after: What larval characters are still telling us about the phylogeny of frogs

The Phyloinformatics Lab participating in this year's Hennig Meeting in Mexico City bringing a talk iin collaboration with the amazing Drs. Pedro Henrique dos Santos Dias and Alexander Haas (Leibniz Institut Zur Analyse Des Biodiversitätswandels-LIB). The talk is entitled “Twenty years after: What larval characters are still telling us about the phylogeny of frogs (Amphibia: Anura)” and the slides are available in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13126486).

## Exciting News: Elected Fellow of the Willi Hennig Society

I am thrilled to share that I have been elected as a Fellow of the Willi Hennig Society, a prestigious recognition within the field of systematics and phylogenetics. The election results were share with me on July 31, 2024. This honor, which follows a successful election process, reflects my ongoing commitment to advancing the science of evolutionary biology.

As a Fellow, I look forward to contributing further to the Society's mission, participating in its future elections, and potentially serving in leadership roles. This is an exciting opportunity to engage with a community dedicated to the rigorous study and application of phylogenetics.

Thank you to my peers and colleagues for their support, and to the Willi Hennig Society for this remarkable honor.
