# Hispanic potluck

This event was be a potluck to honor the Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 to October 15, 2023) organized by [SACNAS](https://www.sacnas.org/) (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science) in collaboration with [CCI's Diversity and Equity Committee](https://cci.charlotte.edu/cci-fast-facts/diversity/). We encouraged students to bring their favorite national dish for everyone to share and have opportunities for socialization and community.

We were very happy to help making this event come true and we are looking forward for more collaborations with SACNAS and other organizations on campus.
