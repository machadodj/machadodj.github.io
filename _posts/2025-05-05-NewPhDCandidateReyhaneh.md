We are thrilled to share that Reyhaneh Nouri has successfully passed her dissertation proposal defense and is now officially a Ph.D. candidate in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at UNC Charlotte!

Reyhaneh’s work explores the genetic regulation of mutable collagenous tissue in brittle stars—research with exciting implications for biomaterials and regenerative science. Her defense showcased not only scientific rigor but also creativity, clarity, and remarkable poise.

We’re proud of Reyhaneh’s achievements and can’t wait to see where her research takes her next. Congratulations, Candidate Nouri—you’ve earned this milestone!
