# Hispanic Heritage Month

Olá! Denis here. I am part of CCI's committee of diversity and inclusion. I am also a member of the Hispanic/Latinx Staff/Faculty Caucus. In those capacities, it is my pleasure to announce: the **Hispanic Heritage Month** has started!

## What is the Hispanic Heritage Month

The Hispanic Heritage Month is a month-long celebration of the history, culture, and contributions of Hispanic and Latine people. It is observed annually from September 15 to October 15. The dates were chosen to coincide with the independence days of several Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua (September 15), Mexico (September 16), and Chile (September 18).

There are many ways to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. Some people attend festivals, concerts, and other cultural events. Others learn about Hispanic history and culture by reading books, watching movies, or visiting museums. There are even those who volunteer their time to help Hispanic communities. No matter how you choose to celebrate, Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to honor the rich and diverse heritage of Hispanic and Latino Americans.

## Some interesting facts about the Hispanic Heritage Month
