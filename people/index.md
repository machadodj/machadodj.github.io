# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Our Team and External Collaborators

The Phyloinformatics Lab was inaugurated on August 15, 2022, as part of [UNC Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/)'s [CIPHER](https://cipher.charlotte.edu/) research center. We are also always happy to discuss further collaborations.
