# <i class="fas fa-seedling"></i>Outreach and research communication

This is a work in progress. Whenever possible, I'll add materials from recent oral presentations in here. Over time, I will also add older materials from older talks.

## The "Phylogenetics as Applied to Infectious Diseases" Symposium at the XL Hennig Meeting

This symposium was organized by Drs. Daniel Janies and Denis Jacob Machado at the [The XL Annual Meeting of the Willi Hennig Society](https://cladistics.org/2023/03/01/hennig-xl-annual-meeting/) (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY July 9th -13th, 2023). The symposium took place on July 11, 2023.

### Program

- 2:10-3 pm, Czech & Stamatakis: “Leveraging phylogenetic placement to understand the environmental drivers of microbial community composition”
- 3-3:40pm, Dornburg, Hassler, and Townsend: “An evolving future for pandemic preparedness: evolutionary medicine and phylogenetic comparative methods inform the durability of SARS-CoV-2 immunity”
- 4:10-4:50 pm, Ocaña, Silva, Coelho, Terra, & Osthoff: “Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of dengue virus serotypes in Brazil: User-steering in large-scale phylogenomic workflows”

### SBE meetings (2020-22)

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our lab has co-founded and co-organized **Virtual Meetings in Systematics, Biogeography, and Evolution** (SBE), also known as the SBE meetings.

The main goals of the Virtual Meetings of Systematics, Biogeography, and Evolution are:

- First, provide a **high-quality international scientific meeting** on systematics, biogeography, and evolution.
- Second, make the event **accessible** to people that could have difficulty attending other international scientific events due to financial constraints or the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Third, **promote diversity and gender equality** in science, technology, agronomy, mathematics, and medicine (STEAMM).

For those reasons, the first three editions (2020, 2021, and 2022) of the SBE meeting were **100% online** and  **100% free** for all attendees.
