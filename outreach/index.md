### SBE meetings (2020-22)

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our lab has co-founded and co-organized **Virtual Meetings in Systematics, Biogeography, and Evolution** (SBE), also known as the SBE meetings.

The main goals of the Virtual Meetings of Systematics, Biogeography, and Evolution are:

- First, provide a **high-quality international scientific meeting** on systematics, biogeography, and evolution.
- Second, make the event **accessible** to people that could have difficulty attending other international scientific events due to financial constraints or the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Third, **promote diversity and gender equality** in science, technology, agronomy, mathematics, and medicine (STEAMM).

For those reasons, the first three editions (2020, 2021, and 2022) of the SBE meeting were **100% online** and  **100% free** for all attendees.
