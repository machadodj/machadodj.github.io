## Who am I?

Hello!

I’m a M.Sc. student at the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC), with a strong interest in applying genomic approaches to evolutionary biology.

Currently, I am investigating the in-silico landscape of genome recombination in dengue viruses under the supervision of Dr. Kary Ocaña and Dr. Denis Jacob Machado.
