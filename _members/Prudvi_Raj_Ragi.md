# Prudvi Raj Ragi

## Background

Hello, I am Prudvi Raj Ragi, currently pursuing an MS in Bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I have a strong background in biotechnology and data analysis. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biotechnology from Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research, where I led research projects such as the molecular analysis of sickle cell anemia and comparative studies on the phytochemical profile of Solanum Nigrum. My expertise in data science was further developed during my tenure at Zetabytes Communications, where I analyzed COVID-19 data using Python and created interactive dashboards and reports to uncover key trends.

## What am I working on?

I am currently focused on investigating sodium channel gene mutations in poison dart frogs, specifically exploring how these mutations may confer resistance to their own lipophilic alkaloids. My work involves creating comprehensive amino acid alignments and building specialized databases to support this research. I am responsible for tasks such as data curation and organization, conducting formal analyses, and validating mutation patterns. For these processes, I utilize SQL databases and Python programming for data management and analysis. Additionally, I employ bioinformatics tools like UniProt and NCBI for gene annotation and Hidden-Markov Models for sequence alignment. My work includes visualizing the results of these analyses, drafting a manuscript for publication, and preparing a poster presentation to communicate the findings. The aim is to identify and compare unique amino acid mutations within a broad phylogenetic context, distinguishing poison dart frogs from other taxa.
