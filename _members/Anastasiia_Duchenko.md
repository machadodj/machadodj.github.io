# Anastasiia Duchenko

Anastasiia is a Ukrainian scientist with a Master’s in Molecular Biology and Genetics and over seven years of industry experience in drug development, drug delivery with hydrogel nanoparticles, and both clinical and pre-clinical research. Anastasiia is particularly passionate about deriving meaningful insights from complex data to optimize research accuracy and efficiency. She is highly self-motivated and goal-oriented.

## Current Status

PhD student and Teaching Assistant.

## Current Research Focus

Over the past year, Anastasiia has been leveraging advanced computational tools such as AlphaFold2, ChimeraX, HADDOCK (v2.4 and v3.0), and PRODIGY. She has also been involved in developing Singularity containers and utilizing High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources at the UNC Charlotte cluster. During her first rotation in the Phyloinformatics lab, she focused on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 variant receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins and predicting their docking interactions with antibodies and ACE2 receptors.

## Scientific Interests
