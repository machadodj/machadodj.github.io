Hello!

I am Iranian, and my pronouns are she/her. I received my Pharm.D. from Islamic Azad University, Tehran Medical Sciences branch. Pharmaceutical sciences' computational applications sparked my interest in bioinformatics. Therefore, I decided to pursue a graduate degree in this field. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in bioinformatics and computational biology at UNC Charlotte.

Before joining the Phyloinformatics Lab, I worked as a research assistant on Drs. Cynthia Gibas and Jessica Schlueter's COVID-19 wastewater surveillance project. Now, I am interested in studying machine learning applications in One Health.
