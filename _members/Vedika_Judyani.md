# Vedika Judyani

## Background

Hello, I am Vedika Judyani (ORCiD: [0009-0007-7660-8134](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-7660-8134), GitHub: [Vedika_j](https://gitlab.com/Vedika_j)), and I am currently pursuing an MS in Bioinformatics with a background in molecular biology and scientific data curation. My goal is to excel in the field of data science, driven by my passion for biological data. My interest in bioinformatics was significantly enhanced through my work in the Phyloinformatics lab, where I learned about recombination transformations using Python and machine learning. I also learned how to build pipelines for simulations and recombinations. This experience provided me with a better understanding of how algorithms work in machine learning and how biological models are applied to solve various problems related to simulation and recombination.


## What I am Learning at the Phyloinformatics Lab

- Python Skills: Improved my Python skills from scratch with hands-on practice.
- Machine Learning: Gained a better understanding of machine learning algorithms and how pseudocode works.
- Data Cleaning: Learn why cleaning data is crucial before starting any analysis.
- Automation: Learned and discovered ways to automate tasks, which is much faster than doing things manually.
- Organization: Realized how important it is to keep things detailed and well-organized.
- Team Appreciation: Learned to celebrate team successes and appreciate everyone’s contributions.
- Documentation: Understood the value of documenting everything to make work easier and more manageable.
- Work Culture: Experienced a positive work culture that respects everyone’s time and allows intellectual creativity.
