I am a Ph.D. student in UNC Charlotte's Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics. I have a Master's in information technology and Bachelor in computer science. My interest in bioinformatics comes from its pivotal role in developing vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The severity and worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were met with the scientific community's heroic efforts, including medicine, biology, public health, and computer science researchers. That effort led to the rapid development of several novel vaccines. Bioinformatics played a key role in producing the new COVID-19 vaccines in record time by helping to process large datasets from multiple disciplines. I am inspired by what bioinformaticists accomplished during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their efforts serve as a great source of inspiration and motivation.

I am interested in using my background in computer science to advance the field of bioinformatics and genomics, solving practical and urgent medical problems and improving healthcare.
