# Shivam Patel

Lat update: Sept. 23, 2024.

## Background

Hello, I am Shivam Patel, currently pursuing an MS in Bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC). I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biology with a minor in Bioinformatics from UNCC, where I developed a deep interest in computational biology and genomics. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted a variety of research projects, including a phylogenetic analysis of avian Opsin and Rhodopsin genes, which provided insights into the evolutionary adaptations of diurnal and nocturnal birds. I also worked on identifying potential genetic markers in brain tumors, applying bioinformatics tools to investigate gene expression patterns and mutations.

These experiences helped me build a solid foundation in data analysis, bioinformatics, and genomic research, enabling me to develop skills in managing large datasets, using R and Python for analysis, and applying statistical methods to biological problems. I have always been passionate about understanding how genetics and computational techniques can come together to address complex biological questions, which drives my current academic and research pursuits.

## What am I working on?

Currently (as of September, 2024), I am focused on reviewing research papers published since 2016 on sodium channel mutations in poison dart frogs. This literature review will inform the introduction of a project that revisits the groundbreaking work of Tarvin et al. (2016), which explored toxin resistance mechanisms in these frogs. My responsibilities include data curation, reviewing the latest research, and preparing materials for manuscript drafting and a poster presentation.

Throughout this project, I’m working with advanced bioinformatics tools such as AutoDock Vina, GROMACS, HADDOCK3, and cluster computing to deepen my understanding of protein docking analysis. This project is laying the groundwork for further studies into the relationship between sodium channel mutations and chemical defense mechanisms in poison dart frogs.
