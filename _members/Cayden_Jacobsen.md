# Meet Mr. Cayden Jacobsen

While at the Phyloinfomratics Lab, Mr. Cayden Jacobsen was a rising Senior at UNC Charlotte enrolled in the Biology Honors Program. He had a strong background in consulting, with over a year of experience. After graduation, Cayden returned to the consulting field to work on technology implementation and strategy. In his free time, Cayden enjoys skiing, kayaking, weight lifting, and watching football (Go Jets!).

Cayden's research focused on optimizing the speed and usability of [FLAVi](https://gitlab.com/MachadoDJ/FLAVi), an application that annotates the genomes of viruses belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family.
