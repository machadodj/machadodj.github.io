# Hannah Zeru

I am an undergraduate student at UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science. My concentration is AI, Robotics, and Gaming, and I am focusing on the application of AI in games. I have an Associate of Arts and Level One Simulation and Game Development certificate from Central Piedmont Community College.

During the Summer semester of 2023, I participated in the REU Site on [Smart and Sefure Future Computing](https://reu.charlotte.edu/) at UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics. The REU Site was funded by the National Science Foundation (6th Site Award, [NSF #2244424](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2244424)). Anastasiia Duchenko and Drs. Denis Jacob Machado and Paula Prieto Oliveira trained me. Togther with my colleague Mr. Cameron Jones, we worked on replicating and automatizing a previous study that predicted SARS-CoV-2 binding affinities to antibodies ([Ford et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.3389/fviro.2023.1172027)).
