Dr. Denis Jacob Machado is an assistant professor in bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte), College of Computing and Informatics (CCI), Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics (BiG), starting on Aug. 15, 2022. He was one of the first hires of the Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental Risks (CIPHER) research center.

# Highlights

- Peer-reviewed publications on topics including **genomics**, **evolution**, **parasitology**, **regeneration**, **emerging infectious diseases**, and **genomic epidemiology**.

- 3+ years of experience using **machine learning** (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), **predictive modeling**, **high-throughput data processing**, and **data mining** algorithms to solve practical problems.

- 10+ years of experience in **molecular biology**, **high-throughput sequencing** (e.g., Illumina, PacBio, Hi-C, GWAS, and RNA-Seq), sequence assembly, and differential gene expression analyses.

- Concepts used in my current and past projects include Python, Flask, R, Shiny, Tableau, SQL, Git, Jupyter, AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold, HADDOCK, SQL, and AWS.

# Experience

## August 15, 2022--Current

**Assistant Professor in Bioinformatics**, _University of North Carolina at Charlotte_, Charlotte--NC, USA.

- Head of the Phyloinformatics Lab at the College of Computing in Informatics (CCI), Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics (BiG), Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental Risks (CIPHER) research center.
- Dr. Jacob Machado is Brazilian. He was BiG's first Latine faculty.

## 2019–2022

**Postdoctoral Researcher**, _University of North Carolina at Charlotte_, Charlotte--NC, USA.

- I studied the origins, evolution, and zoonotic events of coronaviruses. I also employed big data analysis to categorize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and applied deep learning techniques to produce highly accurate structure predictions of their proteins.
- I predict how structural changes in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 may reduce antibody interaction without completely evading existing neutralizing antibodies (and, therefore, current vaccines).
- I created the first programs for gene prediction and annotation of *Orthocoronavirinae* (including SARS-COV-2) and *Flaviviridae* (including Hepatites C, yellow fever, dengue, and Zika virus) and deployed the pipelines as web applications.
- Produced draft genomes of highly regenerative echinoderms such as brittle stars and sea cucumbers for comparative genomics and tissue regeneration research.

## 2018–2019

**Research Collaborator**, _Universidade de São Paulo_, São Paulo--SP, Brazil.

- I built and administered the first computer clusters at the Muzeum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo (MUZUSP), providing training and technology to bridge the gap between basic animal research and applied bioinformatics with potential biomedical significance.
- I participated in the planning, funding acquisition, and implementation of the first laboratory to sequence historical DNA (e.g., from degraded museum samples) at the Department of Zoology of the University of São Paulo (USP).
- I developed new genome skimming techniques to retrieve genomic data of non-model organisms when samples were small or degraded. I also created the necessary software to facilitate the analysis of organelle genomes, including new indices that check for the completeness of circular genomes or misalignments in other types of contigs and scaffolds.

**Invited Lecturer**, _Universidade de São Paulo_, São Paulo--SP, Brazil.

- I created and taught the first graduate-level courses in bioinformatics and computer programming for biologists at USP’s Graduate Program in Zoology, ranked first in animal research worldwide for several years.

## 2017

**Invited Lecturer**, _Universidad del Magdalena_, Santa Marta D.T.C.H., Colombia.

- I designed and taught the first course in bioinformatics at the University of Magdalena. Classes included practical and theoretical lessons on DNA extraction and isolation, high-throughput sequencing, sequence alignment, reference, and de novo genome assembly, and gene prediction and annotation.
- I also consulted to faculty members involved in animal research who needed web and dry lab solutions for next-generation sequence analyses.
