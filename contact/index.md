### <i class="fas fa-exclamation"></i>How to Reach Out

Olá! Salam! Привіт! नमस्ते! Hi!

We would be thrilled if you consider joining the vibrant community at the Phyloinformatics Lab. We receive many weekly emails from individuals interested in working or collaborating with us, and your enthusiasm is genuinely appreciated!

To streamline our communication and ensure everyone gets the attention they deserve, we've put together a few friendly tips for reaching out, especially if you're a student interested in job opportunities or collaboration:

1. Stay updated on our latest open positions! We regularly post about them in our [news section](https://phyloinformatics.com/news/) and on [UNC Charlotte's applicant site](https://jobs.charlotte.edu/postings/search). All paid opportunities will be listed there, and we kindly ask that inquiries about such positions come in response to these posts.
2. Before reaching out, take a moment to explore our lab's mission, vision, and research areas on our [homepage](https://phyloinformatics.com/). Please familiarize yourself with the goals of UNC Charlotte's [CIPHER center](https://cipher.charlotte.edu/) and the [Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics](Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics), our proud location. Dive into our [research](https://phyloinformatics.com/research/) projects, and let us know what aspects caught your eye.
3. When you contact us, share your specific interests in our lines of research and outline your overarching goals as a student or researcher. While you don't need a fully formed research plan, we're open to detailed ideas and suggestions for potential funding opportunities.
4. Make your email uniquely yours! If it feels too generic and seems like a copy-paste message that could go to any lab, it might be mistaken for spam, and unfortunately, we won't be able to respond.
5. If your question is about applying to become a student, perhaps in one of our graduate programs in bioinformatics, you should first check the details on UNC Charlotte's website. For example, [click here](https://cci.charlotte.edu/academics/bioinformatics/bioinformatics-ms-program/) to read about our Master's in bioinformatics and [click here](https://gradadmissions.charlotte.edu/programs/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology-phd#:~:text=The%20Ph.,worldwide%20in%20academia%20and%20industry) to read about the Ph.D. program on bioinformatics and computational biology.


We're eager to connect with individuals who share our passion for phyloinformatics, and we look forward to hearing from you. Your thoughtful approach will undoubtedly make our interaction more fruitful. Let's embark on this exciting journey together!

### <i class="fas fa-exclamation"></i>Acknowledgement

We acknowledge the Catawba, Waxhaw, Cheraw, and Sugeree peoples, who are the traditional custodians of the land that The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is located, and, as many of us are settlers, migrants, or descendants of those forcefully brought to this land, we are here because this land is colonized. We would also like to recognize the many enslaved and indentured peoples who were forced to dedicate their labor to the construction of what is now Mecklenburg County. To these peoples and their descendants, we acknowledge the grave injustices inflicted on them and recognize the indelible mark of their labor on the creation of the space in which we gather today.
