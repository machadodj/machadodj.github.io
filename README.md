# Run Locally

Source: [click here](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template/wiki/Advanced-Editing).

## Build site locally

Normally your site is built automatically on GitHub if you're using [one of the standard workflows](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template/wiki/Get-Started#edit-your-site). But if you want to preview changes to your site before pushing them to your GitHub repo for all to see, you can follow these steps to build and run the site on your computer. Most people wont need or want to do this.

1. [Install Ruby v3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (on Windows, use the [installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and the recommended version with the Devkit).
2. [Install Bundler](https://bundler.io/) by running `gem install bundler.
3. [Install Jekyll] by running `gem install jekyll`.
4. Go to the folder where you cloned your site, e.g. `cd your-lab-website`.
5. Bundle the site by running `bundle`.
6. Start the site by running `bundle exec jekyll serve --open-url --livereload --trace`.

If you're on Windows and getting errors, see [this thread](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/issues/96).

The site should automatically open in a browser. Any changes you make should automatically rebuild the site and refresh the page, except for changes to _config.yaml which require re-running the start command.

## Build citations locally

Normally your citations are built automatically on GitHub if you're using [one of the standard workflows](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template/wiki/Get-Started#edit-your-site). But if you want to preview changes to your citations before pushing them to your GitHub repo for all to see, or GitHub is having problems generating the citations, you can follow these steps to run the automatic citation process on your computer. Most people wont need or want to do this.

1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (with PIP).
2. Go to the folder where you cloned your site, e.g. `cd your-lab-website`.
3. Install needed Python packages by running `python -m pip install --upgrade --requirement ./auto-cite/requirements.txt`.
4. Add or change the desired `sources/papers` in `/_data/sources.yaml`.
5. Generate citations by running python `./auto-cite/auto-cite.pyRi.

Citations should be automatically generated and output to `/_data/citations.yaml.
