# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Current research and past production

The Phyloinformatics Lab's **research program** consists of two interrelated components:
1. Conceptual aspects of molecular phylogenetics and its computational and epidemiological applications, and
2. Comparative genomics of animals with a focus on host-pathogen systems.

Our **general aims** are four:

1. Facilitate resource-efficient molecular analyses and make data from museum biorepositories more readily available to biomedical research.
2. Improve genomic resources of non-model organisms with a focus on animals of particular medical or environmental interest.
3. Develop phylogenetics solutions, especially if they can help improve our understanding of zoonosis.
4. Integrate “omics” technologies (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) to study complex host-pathogen systems in the context of One Health.
